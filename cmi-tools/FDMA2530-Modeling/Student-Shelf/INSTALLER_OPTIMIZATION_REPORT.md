# Installer Optimization for Student Use Case

## Problem Identified
The initial code deduplication approach had a fundamental flaw for the primary use case: **students only receive the installer file**.

## Student Installation Scenario Analysis

### The Reality
1. **Students receive**: Only `setup_drag_drop_fdma2530.py` 
2. **Students drag**: The installer file into Maya
3. **At installation time**: `fdma_shelf` package doesn't exist yet
4. **Import behavior**: All `from fdma_shelf.utils.*` imports FAIL
5. **Result**: Always uses fallback code with unnecessary overhead

### Deduplication Problems
```python
# This approach added overhead without benefit:
def get_platform():
    try:
        from fdma_shelf.utils.system_utils import get_os_name  # ALWAYS FAILS
        return get_os_name()
    except ImportError:  # ALWAYS EXECUTES
        # Fallback code (always used)
```

**Issues:**
- ❌ ImportError on every function call
- ❌ Unnecessary try/except overhead  
- ❌ More complex code path
- ❌ No performance benefit
- ❌ Deduplication never actually works for students

## Solution: Simplified Installer

### Optimized for Primary Use Case
Reverted to direct implementations optimized for when students only have the installer:

```python
# Simplified, efficient approach:
def get_platform():
    """Detect the current operating system platform."""
    import platform
    system = platform.system().lower()
    if system == "darwin":
        return "macos"
    elif system == "windows":
        return "windows"
    elif system == "linux":
        return "linux"
    else:
        return "unknown"
```

### Benefits of Simplified Approach
- ✅ **Faster execution**: No failed import attempts
- ✅ **Predictable behavior**: Single code path
- ✅ **Less complexity**: Direct implementations
- ✅ **Optimized for students**: Primary use case
- ✅ **No overhead**: Efficient function calls

## Functions Simplified

### 1. `get_platform()`
- **Before**: Try import → ImportError → fallback (always)
- **After**: Direct platform detection

### 2. `safe_download()`  
- **Before**: Try import → ImportError → fallback (always)
- **After**: Direct urllib implementation

### 3. `_read_manifest_version()`
- **Before**: Try import → try fallback → ImportError → fallback (always)
- **After**: Direct JSON reading

## Performance Impact

### Before (Deduplication)
```
Function Call → Try Import → ImportError → Exception Handling → Fallback Code
```

### After (Simplified)
```
Function Call → Direct Implementation
```

**Result**: Significantly faster and more predictable execution for students.

## Key Insight

**Deduplication is only valuable when both pieces of code might actually be used.**

In the student scenario:
- Students receive **only** the installer
- The `fdma_shelf` package **doesn't exist** during installation  
- Deduplication attempts **always fail**
- Fallback code **always executes**

Therefore, the "deduplication" was actually adding complexity without removing any duplication from the student experience.

## Conclusion

The installer is now **optimized for its primary use case**: students installing the tools for the first time. The code is:

- **Simpler**: Direct implementations without unnecessary complexity
- **Faster**: No failed import attempts or exception handling overhead
- **More reliable**: Single, predictable code path
- **Student-focused**: Designed for the actual deployment scenario

This approach prioritizes the real-world use case over theoretical code reuse that never actually happens in practice.
